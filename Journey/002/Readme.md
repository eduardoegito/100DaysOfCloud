# Time for planning

## Introduction

On the first day, I get to know how the 100DaysOfCloud Challenge works and how other developers took their journey.
I planned to take the journey by selecting some ideas from the repository [100DaysOfCloudIdeas](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas) and get them automated with Terraform.
My next activities will be based on the ideas listed below:

- [COM03-AWS100 - Launch a Hello World website on the internet](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/COM/COM03/COM03-AWS100.md)
- [COM03-AWS200 - Create an Auto Scaling Group](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/COM/COM03/COM03-AWS200.md)
- [COM04-AWS200 - Deploy a Docker container image on AWS Fargate](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/COM/COM04/COM04-AWS200.md)
- [NET04-AWS100 â€” Host a simple static webpage with S3 and CloudFront](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/NET/NET04/NET04-AWS100.md)
- [STR03-AWS200 - Create an EFS shared file system](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/STR/STR03/STR03-AWS200.md)
- [STR04-AWS100 - Create an S3 Bucket and store an object in it](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/STR/STR04/STR04-AWS100.md)
- [OPS01-AWS300 - Deploy a VPC with Terraform](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/OPS/OPS01/OPS01-AWS300.md)
## Prerequisite

I already have knowledge about the AWS Services that are required to do the activities listed above and I have some basic knowledge about how Terraform works, however, I didn't use Terraform to automate AWS services so far.
To be more prepared to work with Terraform I will take a course from LinuxTips called [Terraform Uncomplicated](https://www.linuxtips.io/products/treinamento-descomplicando-o-terraform). My plan is to finish the course in a week.
